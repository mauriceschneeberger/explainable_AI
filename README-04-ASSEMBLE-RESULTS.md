# Assemble the Results of Model Training
This document discusses on how to assemble and analyze the models trained in the previous step.  
The analysis is facilitated via the notebook [result_assembly_fin.ipynb](result_assembly_fin.ipynb).


## File Paths
Here we define two variables. 
* `INPUT_DIR`
  * Defines the location where the model weights, trained by [README-03-FIT-MODEL.md](README-03-FIT-MODEL.md), will be loaded from.
* `OUTPUT_DIR`
  * Defines the location where the analysis results will be saved to. This includes the loss curves and model performance metrics.

## Model Definition
One defines the parameters `version`, `model_version`, 
 `comp_mode`, `model_nrs`, and `which_splits` such that they correspond to the values utilized to train the model one whishes to analyze.

## Model Analysis
The model is recreated according to the previously defined parameters and the weights are loaded. 

The tuned weights are also calculated. This means that for every ensemble each of the ensembles members get their weight tuned in such a way that, for one data split, they optimally predict the outcome of the validation data set.

Now for every split and every member of the ensemble predictions for the binary mrs outcome are made.

## Classification Threshold Calculation
On the validation data the calssification threshold is calculated and then applied to the test data. The standard deviation of prediction is normalized and then serves as a measure of uncertainty.

## Result Analysis
The previously generated result data is now visualized. 

This includes the following results:
* Boxplots of the mean log-odds ratio of the `estimated average betas` per ``variable``. For:
  * `means_per_parameter`
  * `means_per_parameter_w`
* The model evaluation metrics as tables, for the untuned and tuned Transformation models.
* The performance metrics on the test set.
* The training and validation loss curves gathered during training.
